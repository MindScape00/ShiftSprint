v2.3.1 (Dec. 11, 2017)
	- Add in ability for ShiftSprint to handle swimming (/ss swim # to set it)
	- Changed from '.cast' to '.aura # self' for the casting of spells. This will stop spells being placed on target instead of yourself.
	- Changed the 'return' speed handling - it will now try and save your previous set speed to return you to, instead of just returning you to speed 1.
		- Note: This will fail if you spam your sprint in rapid succession, as it's set instantly when hitting the sprint button - if you hit it while the server is still processing changing your speed back from a previous sprint, it will adopt those numbers and put you in eternal sprint speed - unless you change it back with ".mod speed" again. This may change in the future if we get proper API from the server and begin monitoring chat for when you actually set your speed, but that may be awhile.

v2.2.1 (Aug. 3, 2017)
	- Added in a check to remove default binding that conflicted with Sprint-Jumping.
	- Added in warnings if you have alternate bindings conflicting, but didn't auto remove them. (May not actually work completely?)
	- Added in "/ssjumpreset" to remove any conflicting bindings automatically.
	
----------------------------------------

v2.2.0 (July 31, 2017)
	- Changed spell system (ShiftSpells)
		- Condensed into a single /command (/sspell)
			- Now accepts "all/walk/fly/off" to set the setting instead of an entirely separate command
			- Now accepts "list" as an argument to list out current spells
		- Remade Spell Setting, can now simply add to current list, or set a new list.
			- i.e., '/sspell add 12345' will add spell 12345 ontop of the current set spells.
				- '/sspell set 12345' will remove all other spells and only do spell 12345.
		- Fixed Spells not disabling in certain situations if you use "On-Foot Only" or "Fly-Only" settings.
	- Fixed Chat Filter on Mod Speed messages to only be active while sprinting / stopping sprinting.
	- Localized all variables to increase compatibility with other ConvenientCommand addons.
	- Fixed commands if you use capitals (oversight).
